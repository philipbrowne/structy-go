# uncompress string

Write a function, uncompress, that takes in a string as an argument. The input string will be formatted into multiple groups according to the following pattern:

`<number><char>`

for example, `"2c"` or `"3a".`

The function should return an uncompressed version of the string where each 'char' of a group is repeated 'number' times consecutively. You may assume that the input string is well-formed according to the previously mentioned pattern.

```
uncompress("2c3a1t"); // -> "ccaaat"
uncompress("4s2b"); // -> "ssssbb"
uncompress("2p1o5p"); // -> "ppoppppp"
```
