# fiveSort

Write a function, fiveSort, that takes in a list of numbers as an argument. The function should rearrange elements of the list such that all 5s appear at the end. Your function should perform this operation in-place by mutating the original list. The function should return the list.

Elements that are not 5 can appear in any order in the output, as long as all 5s are at the end of the array.

fiveSort([12, 5, 1, 5, 12, 7]);
// -> [12, 7, 1, 12, 5, 5] 


fiveSort([5, 2, 5, 6, 5, 1, 10, 2, 5, 5]);
// -> [2, 2, 10, 6, 1, 5, 5, 5, 5, 5]
