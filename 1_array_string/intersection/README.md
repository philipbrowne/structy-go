#Intersection

Write a function, intersection, that takes in two slices, a,b, as arguments. The function should return a new slice containing elements that are in both of the two arrays.

You may assume that each input slice does not contain duplicate elements.

```
test_00:
intersection([4,2,1,6], [3,6,9,2,10]) // -> [2,6]
test_01:
intersection([2,4,6], [4,2]) // -> [2,4]
test_02:
intersection([4,2,1], [1,2,4,6]) // -> [1,2,4]
test_03:
intersection([0,1,2], [10,11]) // -> []
```
